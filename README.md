# Coffee Quality Analysis
Welcome to my Coffee Quality Analysis project!

## Motivation
This was my first personal project to help teach myself how to analyze data in Python. I wanted to practice my data analysis skills and decided to use this particular dataset to understand if coffee reviews from different parts of the world differ. 

## Data
The dataset for this project was taken from [jldbc](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database), who collected this in 2018 and I focused on these 
particular measures of quality (features):

Note: I am only working with arabica (vs. robusta) since it has a larger dataset to work with. 

* Aroma
* Flavor
* Aftertaste
* Acidity
* Body
* Balance
* Uniformity
* Cup Cleanliness
* Sweetness

## Questions

1. In this dataset, which countries produce the most coffee?

2. Are the average total ratings of coffee from the top 10 country similar?

3. Do we need all category ratings to describe the coffee?

4. Is there one quality or few qualities which can predict overall coffee quality?
  
## Methods

### Q1: 
* Ranked bar chart and boxplots

### Q2
* Shapiro-Wilks and D'Agostino-Pearson: test normality
* Kruskal-Wallis: Non parametric test for similarity between groups
* Dunn Test: identify different groups

###  Q3
* PCA: Reduce dimensions and visualization

## Results

### Q1
Top 10 coffee suppliers are:
1. Mexico
2. Colombia
3. Guatemala
4. Brazil
5. Taiwan
6. United States (Hawaii)
7. Honduras
8. Costa Rica
9. Ethiopia
10. Tanzania

### Q2

The majority of each group (countries) had an non-Gaussian distribution.

Kruskal-Wallis test determined there were differences in overall coffee quality and Dunn Test identified some groups to be different (see image).

### Q3

When examining covariance, three principal components captured 82.6% of explained variance.

Coffee from all countries clustered together with Mexico (red dots) least amount of clustering.

## Discussion
What did I learn?
Coffee from around the world are ranked very similarly or that I need to expand my dataset to better discriminate coffee from different countries. 

## Future Directions
Will webscrape 2019 (most recent) dataset and use more features.
